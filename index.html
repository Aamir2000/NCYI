            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our Mission

                with God to
                promote mutually caring, loving and humane communities. Accordingly, the YMCA participates in God’s mission
                of restoring
                abundant life for all, with special concern for the most distressed and dehumanized in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Indian YMCA is committed to strive for a just society where oppression, exploitation and denial of life
                is
                confronted and transformed. It believes in the sanctity of all life and preservation of all God’s creation.
                It stands
                for renewal and reconciliation in broken communities.
